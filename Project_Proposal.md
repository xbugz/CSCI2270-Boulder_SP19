Rough project outline

For our project, we will have a Hash Table consisting of all the NBA players in the league with all of their statistics within the 2018-2019 regular season (i.e points per game, rebounds per game, total points etc..). 
We will then have have a user interface where the user can choose to compare a certain player to other players of similar tier, or select a player or multitude of players  to view all of their statistics.

In the case where the player wants to compare a player to similar players. 
The data will be organized into a Binary Search Tree, and it will be organized by who has better or worse stats than the primary player being compared to.
The binary search tree will be organized based on which statistic the user wants to view, for example if it is points per game the BST will be organized by the amount of points per game of every player with the chosen player at the root.
To the right will be players with higher points per game and to the left will be players with less points per game. 

This method will be applied to different statistics that players can have. 

Datastructures to be used:

Heap
BST
LL (maybe)
